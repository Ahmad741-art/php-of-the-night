In Object-Oriented PHP:

1. **Class**: A template for creating objects. It defines properties (variables) and methods (functions).
2. **Object**: An instance of a class. Each object can have its own values for properties and can use class methods.
3. **Properties**: Variables inside a class that hold data specific to an object.
4. **Methods**: Functions inside a class that define what the object can do.
5. **Constructor**: A special function that initializes an object's properties when it's created.
6. **Encapsulation**: Controls access to class data using `public`, `private`, or `protected` keywords.
7. **Inheritance**: One class can extend another, inheriting its properties and methods.

It helps organize code better by grouping related data and functionality.
